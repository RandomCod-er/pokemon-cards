# Pokémon Cards - Interactive Web App

An interactive web app showcasing Pokémon cards with dynamic light/dark mode switching, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses Pokémon sprites from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), displaying Pokémon characters along with their types in a responsive card layout.

## Features
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark and light mode using the button at the top.
- **Responsive Layout**: The cards adapt to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop users.
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects on the Pokémon cards with scaling and shadow transitions.
- **Persistent Theme**: The theme (light or dark) is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, so your preference is maintained even after reloading the page.


## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup for the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, dark mode, hover effects, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity for toggling between light and dark mode and saving the theme preference in `localStorage`.

## Credits

- **Pokémon Sprites**: All Pokémon sprites used in this project are sourced from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), which provides open access to Pokémon data, including images and stats. The specific URLs used for the images are hosted on GitHub.
- **Icons**: The dark mode toggle button icons and design were created by the developer.
