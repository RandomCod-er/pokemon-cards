Pokémon Cards - Interactive Web App
An interactive web app showcasing Pokémon cards with dynamic light/dark mode switching, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses Pokémon sprites from the PokeAPI, displaying Pokémon characters along with their types in a responsive card layout.

Features
Dark Mode: Toggle between dark and light mode using the button at the top.
Responsive Layout: The cards adapt to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop users.
Smooth Animations: Hover effects on the Pokémon cards with scaling and shadow transitions.
Persistent Theme: The theme (light or dark) is saved in the browser using localStorage, so your preference is maintained even after reloading the page.
